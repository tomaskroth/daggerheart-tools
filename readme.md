# Daggerheart Tool Workspace

This workspace contains three main folders:

## 1. `frontend`
The React-based web application for browsing and searching the Daggerheart SRD compendium.  
It provides a user-friendly interface to explore abilities, domains, items, and more.

## 2. `backend`
The backend service that serves the SRD data as an API.  
It reads the processed JSON data and exposes endpoints for search and filtering.

## 3. `tools`
Utility scripts for processing and updating the SRD data.  
Notably, `daggerheart_converter.py` clones the SRD Markdown repository, parses the files, and generates a combined JSON file for the backend.

---

## Data Source

All compendium data is sourced from the  [Daggerheart SRD](https://github.com/seansbox/daggerheart-srd.git) repository.  
This workspace periodically pulls updates from that repo and converts the Markdown files into structured JSON for use in the app.
