    STEP 8
    Choose Domain Cards.
    Your class has access to two of the nine Domains included in
    the core set. Choose two cards from your class’s domains,
    which are listed in the upper left of your character sheet. You
    can take one card from each domain or two from a single
    domain, whichever you prefer.

    STEP 9
    Create Your Connections.
    Connections are the relationships between the PCs. To create
    connections, follow these steps:
     • Go around the table and have each player describe their
       characters to one another—at a minimum, their name,
       pronouns, character description, experiences, and the
       answers to their background questions.
     • Discuss potential connections between the PCs using the
       questions included in the “Connections” section of your
       character guide as inspiration.
     • Suggest at least one connection between your character
       and each other player’s PC. Accept any suggested
       connections you want to explore, reject any you don’t.

      Note: A player can reject a suggested connection for any
      reason, and it’s okay if there isn’t an established connection
      between every pair of PCs—you can always discover and
      develop those relationships through play.

Between conflicts, the party can take a rest to recover

Arcane Frame Models
These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through
the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack
with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.

     ARMOR
     Every armor has a name, base damage thresholds, and a base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.
      • An armor’s base armor score indicates how many Armor             While unarmored, your character’s base Armor Score is 0,
        Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are       their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe
        added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PC’s Armor         threshold is equal to twice their level.
        Score can’t exceed 12.
      • An armor’s base thresholds determine its wearer’s major              REDUCING INCOMING DAMAGE
        and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to            When you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to
        calculate their final damage thresholds.                         reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If
      • An armor’s feature is a special rule that stays in effect        your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark Armor
