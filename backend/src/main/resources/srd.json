Or you might want to replace a feature or two, then present it as an entirely different environment. Whether planning your session or even improvising an environment mid-session, you can adjust an existing environment’s stat block to fit the needs of your scene or improvise elements as needed. The environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle creativity.</p>\n<p>When you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those listed on the Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the column that corresponds to your party’s tier.</p>\n<h2>BENCHMARK STATISTICS FOR ENVIRONMENTS BY TIER</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Environment Statistic</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Tier 1</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Tier 2</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Tier 3</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Tier 4</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Damage Dice</td>\n<td>1d6+1 to 1d8+3</td>\n<td>2d6+3 to 2d10+2</td>\n<td>3d8+3 to 3d10+1</td>\n<td>4d8+3 to 4d10+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Difficulty</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>ENVIRONMENT STAT BLOCKS BY TIER</h2>\n<p>This section contains the following stat blocks.</p>\n<h3>TIER 1 (LEVEL 1)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Abandoned%20Grove.md\">Abandoned Grove (Exploration)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Ambushed.md\">Ambushed (Event)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Ambushers.md\">Ambushers (Event)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Bustling%20Marketplace.md\">Bustling Marketplace (Social)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Cliffside%20Ascent.md\">Cliffside Ascent (Traversal)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Local%20Tavern.md\">Local Tavern (Social)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Outpost%20Town.md\">Outpost Town (Social)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Raging%20River.md\">Raging River (Traversal)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>TIER 2 (LEVELS 2–4)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Cult%20Ritual.md\">Cult Ritual (Event)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Hallowed%20Temple.md\">Hallowed Temple (Social)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Haunted%20City.md\">Haunted City (Exploration)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Mountain%20Pass.md\">Mountain Pass (Traversal)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>TIER 3 (LEVELS 5–7)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Burning%20Heart%20of%20the%20Woods.md\">Burning Heart of the Woods (Exploration)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Castle%20Siege.md\">Castle Siege (Event)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Pitched%20Battle.md\">Pitched Battle (Event)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>TIER 4 (LEVELS 8–10)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Chaos%20Realm.md\">Chaos Realm (Traversal)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Divine%20Usurpation.md\">Divine Usurpation (Event)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Imperial%20Court.md\">Imperial Court (Social)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../environments/Necromancers%20Ossuary.md\">Necromancer’s Ossuary (Exploration)</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "content": "<h2>WHAT IS DAGGERHEART?</h2>\n<p>Daggerheart is a tabletop roleplaying game for one Game Master (“GM”) and 2-5 players. Each game session lasts about 2-4 hours, and Daggerheart can be played as a one-shot or a multi-session campaign of any length.</p>\n<p>During a session of Daggerheart the GM describes situations, narrates events, and controls any adversaries or obstacles that the Player Characters (“PCs”) encounter. The players, in turn, roleplay their PCs’ reactions to the scenario presented by the GM. If the outcome of a player’s action depends on fate or fortune, the GM calls for an action roll.</p>\n<p>When a player makes an action roll, they utilize Duality Dice—two differently colored 12-sided dice (“d12s”) representing Hope and Fear. The Duality Dice are rolled, relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is compared to a Difficulty set by the GM. If the total meets or beats the Difficulty, the player succeeds. If it’s lower, they fail. In addition, the situation changes based on which Duality Die rolls higher, either giving the player helpful Hope tokens or generating terrifying Fear tokens for the GM.</p>\n<h2>THE GOLDEN RULE</h2>\n<p>The most important rule of Daggerheart is to make the game your own. The rules included in this SRD are designed to help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. The rules should never get in the way of the story you want to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you want to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can be adjusted to fit your play style. If there’s a rule you’d rather ignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your table’s consent.</p>\n<h2>RULINGS OVER RULES</h2>\n<p>While playing Daggerheart, the GM and players should always prioritize rulings over rules. This SRD offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it won’t answer all of them. When you’re in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative.</p>\n<p>For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesn’t forbid you from doing that—but it doesn’t make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate death—such as diving into an active volcano without protection—you might not get to make one of Daggerheart’s death moves, which normally give you control of your character’s fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world.</p>\n<p>As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.</p>",

When an affected PC makes a move to clear a temporary condition or effect, it normally requires a successful action roll using an appropriate trait.

    "content": "<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>The GM is responsible for guiding the narrative and roleplaying the world the PCs inhabit. This section provides you with advice for running Daggerheart: using the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting sessions; selecting, creating, and using GM moves; crafting a full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more.</p>\n<p>These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game. The “GM Principles” are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles.</p>\n<h2>GM PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<h3>BEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION</h3>\n<p><em>Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics back to the fiction.</em></p>\n<h3>COLLABORATE AT ALL TIMES, ESPECIALLY DURING CONFLICT</h3>\n<p><em>The PCs are the protagonists of the campaign; antagonism between player and GM should exist only in the fiction.</em></p>\n<h3>FILL THE WORLD WITH LIFE, WONDER, AND DANGER</h3>\n<p><em>Showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and introduce them to dangerous creatures.</em></p>\n<h3>ASK QUESTIONS AND INCORPORATE THE ANSWERS</h3>\n<p><em>Ensuring that the players’ ideas are included results in a narrative that supports the whole group’s creativity.</em></p>\n<h3>GIVE EVERY ROLL IMPACT</h3>\n<p><em>Only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments.</em></p>\n<h3>PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS</h3>\n<p><em>Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make, and the people they become.</em></p>\n<h3>HOLD ON GENTLY</h3>\n<p><em>Don’t worry if you need to abandon or alter something that came before.</em></p>\n<h2>GM PRACTICES</h2>\n<h3>CULTIVATE A CURIOUS TABLE</h3>\n<p><em>Follow what catches the players’ interest to foster an environment of creative inquiry.</em></p>\n<h3>GAIN YOUR PLAYERS’ TRUST</h3>\n<p><em>Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your mistakes.</em></p>\n<h3>KEEP THE STORY MOVING FORWARD</h3>\n<p><em>Advance the story through escalating action, new information, or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it succeeds or fails.</em></p>\n<h3>CUT TO THE ACTION</h3>\n<p><em>Skip past the boring bits. When a scene drags on, end it.</em></p>\n<h3>HELP THE PLAYERS USE THE GAME</h3>\n<p><em>Players have more fun when you help them understand the system.</em></p>\n<h3>CREATE A META CONVERSATION</h3>\n<p><em>Empower players to speak out of character, use safety tools, and ask for clarification.</em></p>\n<h3>TELL THEM WHAT THEY WOULD KNOW</h3>\n<p><em>Don’t hide obvious details or important information from the players.</em></p>\n<h3>GROUND THE WORLD IN MOTIVE</h3>\n<p><em>An NPC’s actions flow from their goals and desires.</em></p>\n<h3>BRING THE GAME’S MECHANICS TO LIFE</h3>\n<p><em>Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together to enhance the game experience.</em></p>\n<h3>REFRAME RATHER THAN REJECT</h3>\n<p><em>If a player’s contribution conflicts with the fiction, work with them to reshape it.</em></p>\n<h3>WORK IN MOMENTS AND MONTAGES</h3>\n<p><em>When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savored and which shouldn’t linger.</em></p>\n<h2>PITFALLS TO AVOID</h2>\n<h3>UNDERMINING THE HEROES</h3>\n<p>If a roll doesn’t go well, show how it was impacted by an adversary’s prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected surprises, rather than the PC’s incompetence.</p>\n<h3>ALWAYS TELLING THE PLAYERS WHAT TO ROLL</h3>\n<p>Let the players decide how to handle a challenge.</p>\n<h3>LETTING SCENES DRAG</h3>\n<p>Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the table’s energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.</p>\n<h3>SINGULAR SOLUTIONS</h3>\n<p>Don’t get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the players have a clever idea, make it work.</p>\n<h3>OVERPLANNING</h3>\n<p>Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think through your options.</p>\n<h3>HOARDING FEAR</h3>\n<p>Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will enjoy its immediate impact.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For more in-depth GM guidance, see pg. 140 of the Daggerheart Core Rulebook.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",

    "title": "Combat Wheelchair",
    "slug": "combat-wheelchair",
    "excerpt": "By Mark Thompson",
    "content": "<p><em>By Mark Thompson</em></p>\n<p>The combat wheelchair is a ruleset designed to help you play a wheelchair user in Daggerheart. This section provides mechanics and narrative guidance for you to work from, but feel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character. Have fun with your character’s wheelchair design, and make it as unique or tailored to them as you please.</p>\n<h2>ACTION AND MOVEMENT</h2>\n<p>When describing how your character moves, you can use descriptions such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I roll over to the door to see if it’s open.”</li>\n<li>“I wheel myself over to the group to ask what’s going on.”</li>\n<li>“I pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to level my bow at the intruder.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CONSEQUENCES</h2>\n<p>Here are some ways you might describe complications you encounter when your character uses their wheelchair:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I pull my brakes, but I don’t think to account for the loose gravel on the ground.”</li>\n<li>“I hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out past my target.”</li>\n<li>“I go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster wheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a moment.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GMs should avoid breaking a character’s wheelchair or otherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless everyone at the table, especially the wheelchair user’s player, gives their approval.</p>\n<h2>EVASION</h2>\n<p>Your character is assumed to be skilled in moving their wheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a result, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC’s Evasion is the Heavy Frame model.</p>\n<h2>BURDEN</h2>\n<p>All wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands outside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon, the chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to perform attacks, depending on the model you’ve chosen. If you’re playing a character who has limited to no mobility in their arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical means. For example, your character might use a psychic link to guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All the rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any character’s needs.</p>\n<h2>CHOOSING YOUR MODEL</h2>\n<p>All combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons. There are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy, and arcane. You’re encouraged to consider the type of character you’re playing and the class they belong to, then choose the model that best matches that character concept.</p>\n<h3>LIGHT FRAME MODELS</h3>\n<p>Though tough, these wheelchairs have light frames that allow the chair to move with your character in more acrobatic ways. These models are best suited to adventurers who rely on speed and flexibility.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>NAME</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TIER</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TRAIT</strong></th>\n<th><strong>RANGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>DAMAGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>BURDEN</strong></th>\n<th><strong>FEATURE</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Light-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Agility</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d8 phy</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Quick:</em></strong> When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Improved Light-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Agility</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d8+3 phy</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Quick:</em></strong> When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advanced Light-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Agility</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d8+6 phy</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Quick:</em></strong> When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legendary Light-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Agility</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d8+9 phy</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Quick:</em></strong> When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>HEAVY FRAME MODELS</h3>\n<p>These wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your character’s attacks. It also makes them a bigger target.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>NAME</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TIER</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TRAIT</strong></th>\n<th><strong>RANGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>DAMAGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>BURDEN</strong></th>\n<th><strong>FEATURE</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Heavy-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d12+3 phy</td>\n<td>Two-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Heavy:</em></strong> -1 to Evasion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Improved Heavy-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d12+6 phy</td>\n<td>Two-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Heavy:</em></strong> -1 to Evasion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advanced Heavy-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d12+9 phy</td>\n<td>Two-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Heavy:</em></strong> -1 to Evasion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legendary Heavy-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>Melee</td>\n<td>d12+12 phy</td>\n<td>Two-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Heavy:</em></strong> -1 to Evasion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>ARCANE FRAME MODELS</h3>\n<p>These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>NAME</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TIER</strong></th>\n<th><strong>TRAIT</strong></th>\n<th><strong>RANGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>DAMAGE</strong></th>\n<th><strong>BURDEN</strong></th>\n<th><strong>FEATURE</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arcane-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Spellcast</td>\n<td>Far</td>\n<td>d6 mag</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Reliable:</em></strong> +1 to attack rolls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Improved Arcane-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Spellcast</td>\n<td>Far</td>\n<td>d6+3 mag</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Reliable:</em></strong> +1 to attack rolls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advanced Arcane-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Spellcast</td>\n<td>Far</td>\n<td>d6+6 mag</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Reliable:</em></strong> +1 to attack rolls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legendary Arcane-Frame Wheelchair</strong></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Spellcast</td>\n<td>Far</td>\n<td>d6+9 mag</td>\n<td>One-Handed</td>\n<td><strong><em>Reliable:</em></strong> +1 to attack rolls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

    "content": "<h2>ADVERSARY STAT BLOCKS</h2>\n<p>All the information required to run an adversary is contained in their stat block. An adversary’s stat block includes their:</p>\n<h3>NAME</h3>\n<p>Each stat block has a unique <strong>name</strong>. Abilities that affect adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.</p>\n<h3>TIER</h3>\n<p>Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain <strong>tier</strong>. If you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, adjust their stats.</p>\n<h3>TYPE</h3>\n<p>The adversary’s type appears alongside their tier. An adversary’s <strong>type</strong> represents the role they play in a conflict. The adversary types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bruisers:</strong> tough; deliver powerful attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Hordes:</strong> groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit.</li>\n<li><strong>Leaders:</strong> command and summon other adversaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Minions:</strong> easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranged:</strong> fragile in close encounters but deal high damage at range.</li>\n<li><strong>Skulks:</strong> maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>Socials:</strong> present challenges around conversation instead of combat.</li>\n<li><strong>Solos:</strong> present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support.</li>\n<li><strong>Standards:</strong> representative of their fictional group.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports:</strong> enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>\n<p>A summary of the adversary&rsquo;s appearance and demeanor.</p>\n<h3>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h3>\n<p>Suggusted impulses, actions and goals for the adversary.</p>\n<h3>DIFFICULTY</h3>\n<p>The Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<h3>DAMAGE THRESHOLDS, HIT POINTS, AND STRESS</h3>\n<p>These systems function the same way they do for PCs. The numbers listed after “Threshold” are the adversary’s Major and Severe Thresholds.</p>\n<h3>ATTACK MODIFIER</h3>\n<p>When you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or penalty to your attack roll.</p>\n<h3>STANDARD ATTACK</h3>\n<p>A description of the adversary’s primary mode of inflicting harm on the PCs. It includes the attack’s <strong>name</strong>, its effective <strong>range</strong>, and the <strong>damage</strong> it deals on a success. Using an adversary’s <strong>standard attack</strong> is a GM move.</p>\n<h3>EXPERIENCE (OPTIONAL)</h3>\n<p>The GM can spend a Fear to add an adversary’s relevant Experience to raise their attack roll or increase the Difficulty of a roll made against them.</p>\n<h4>EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Acrobatics</li>\n<li>Ambusher</li>\n<li>Bartering</li>\n<li>Blademaster</li>\n<li>Bodyguard</li>\n<li>Commander</li>\n<li>Hunt from Above</li>\n<li>Intimidation</li>\n<li>Intrusion</li>\n<li>Keen Senses</li>\n<li>Magical Knowledge</li>\n<li>Nature’s Friend</li>\n<li>Navigation</li>\n<li>Nobility</li>\n<li>Quick Reflexes</li>\n<li>Socialite</li>\n<li>Stealth</li>\n<li>Tracker</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>FEATURE(S)</h3>\n<p>There are three kinds of adversary features: <strong>actions, reactions, and passives.</strong> Note: each adversaries stress is tracked individually. If a feature requires the GM to spend Stress to activate it, the Stress must come from the adversary whose feature is being activate. If a feature has a Fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any Fear already spent—for instance, to interrupt the PCs and put the spotlight on the adversary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Actions:</strong> a special attack or other unique action that the adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactions:</strong> special effects that take effect when their trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on the adversary.</li>\n<li><strong>Passives:</strong> special abilities that remain in effect by default and require no resources or triggers to activate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>FEAR FEATURE(S)</h3>\n<p>High-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate.</p>\n<h2>EXAMPLE ADVERSARY FEATURES</h2>\n<h3>ACTIONS</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Haymaker - Action:</em></strong> Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X direct physical damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Shredding Strike - Action:</em></strong> Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X physical damage and the target must mark an Armor Slot without gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the damage).</p>\n<p><strong><em>More Where That Came From - Action:</em></strong> Summon three Jagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range.</p>\n<h3>REACTIONS</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Heavy Hitter - Reaction:</em></strong> When this adversary deals damage with a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to gain a +X bonus to the damage roll.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Team-Up - Reaction:</em></strong> When another adversary within Very Close range of this adversary deals X damage to a creature, you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against that same creature. On a success, combine the damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Momentum - Reaction:</em></strong> When this adversary makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.</p>\n<h3>PASSIVES</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Horde (X) - Passive:</em></strong> When the Horde has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage instead.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Minion (X) - Passive:</em></strong> This adversary is defeated when they take any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Relentless (X) - Passive:</em></strong> This adversary can be spotlighted up to X times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Slow - Passive:</em></strong> When you spotlight this adversary and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and they can act.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Arcane Form - Passive:</em></strong> This adversary is resistant to magic damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Armored Carapace - Passive:</em></strong> When this adversary takes physical damage, reduce it by X.</p>\n<h3>FEAR FEATURES</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Explosion - Action:</em></strong> Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 magic damage and are knocked back to Far range.</p>\n<h2>BUILDING BALANCED ENCOUNTERS</h2>\n<p>When planning a battle, start with <strong>[(3 x the number of PCs in combat) + 2] Battle Points</strong> and make the following adjustments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>-1</strong> for an easier or shorter fight</li>\n<li><strong>-2</strong> if you’re using 2 or more Solo adversaries</li>\n<li><strong>-2</strong> if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to all adversaries’ damage rolls</li>\n<li><strong>+1</strong> if you choose an adversary from a lower tier</li>\n<li><strong>+1</strong> if you don’t include any Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or Solos</li>\n<li><strong>+2</strong> for a harder or longer fight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then spend your Battle Points to add an adversary to the encounter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spend 1 point</strong> for each group of Minions equal to the size of the party.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend 1 point</strong> for each Social or Support adversary.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend 2 points</strong> for each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard adversary.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend 3 points</strong> for each Leader adversary.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend 4 points</strong> for each Bruiser adversary.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend 5 points</strong> for each Solo adversary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>DEFEATED ADVERSARIES</h2>\n<p>When an adversary marks their last Hit Point, they are defeated: incapacitated, tied up, routed, killed, or anything else the table decides makes sense.</p>\n<h2>ADVERSARY STAT BLOCK

The conversions below from abstract ranges to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents about 5 feet of fictional space.</p>\n<p>Daggerheart uses the following <strong>ranges</strong> to translate fictional positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other game mechanics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Melee:</strong> Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.</li>\n<li><strong>Very Close:</strong> Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. <em>On a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2-3 inches).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Close:</strong> Close enough to see prominent details, about 10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range. <em>On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Far:</strong> Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range. <em>On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (11–12 inches).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Very Far:</strong> Too far to make out any details, about 100–300 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee range. <em>On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Out of Range:</strong> Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.</p>\n<p>A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect’s stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Optional Rule: Defined Ranges</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>If your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat.

If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.</p>\n<p>An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.</p>\n<h2>AREA OF EFFECT</h2>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must be within Very Close range of a single origin point within your effect’s range.</p>\n<h2>LINE OF SIGHT &amp; COVER</h2>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have <strong>line of sight</strong> to their intended target to make an attack roll.

Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects, new downtime or social encounter abilities, or one-time benefits.</p>\n<h3>DOMAIN CARD ANATOMY</h3>\n<p>Each domain card includes six elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong><br />\n  The number in the top left of the card indicates the card’s level. You cannot acquire a domain card with a level higher than your PC’s.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Domain</strong><br />\n  Beneath the card’s level there is a symbol indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your class’s two domains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recall Cost</strong><br />\n  The number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its Recall Cost. This is the amount of Stress a player must mark to swap this card from their <strong>vault</strong> with a card from their <strong>loadout</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>A player can swap domain cards during downtime without paying the domain card’s Recall Cost.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Title</strong><br />\n  The name of the card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong><br />\n  The card’s <strong>type</strong> is listed in the center above the title. There are three types of domain cards: <strong>abilities, spells, and grimoires</strong>. Abilities are typically non-magical in nature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to the Codex domain and grant access to a collection of less potent spells. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Feature</strong><br />\n  The text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature(s), including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>LOADOUT &amp; VAULT</h3>\n<p>Your <strong>loadout</strong> is the set of acquired domain cards whose effects your PC can use during play. You can have up to 5 domain cards in your loadout at one time. Once you’ve acquired six or more domain cards, you must choose five to keep in your loadout; the rest are considered to be in your <strong>vault</strong>. Vault cards are inactive and do not influence play.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Your subclass, ancestry, and community cards don’t count toward your loadout or vault and are always active and available.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the start of a rest, before using downtime moves, you can freely move cards between your loadout and your vault, so long as your loadout doesn’t exceed its five-card maximum.</p>\n<p>To move a card from your vault to your loadout at any other time, you must mark a number of Stress equal to the vaulted card’s <strong>Recall Cost</strong> (located in the top right of the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). If your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space, though you can do this at no cost.</p>\n<p>When you gain a new domain card at level-up, you can immediately move it into your loadout for free. If your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space.</p>\n<h3>USAGE LIMITS</h3>\n<p>If a domain card restricts how often it can be used, you can track such limits with whatever method you prefer, such as turning the card sideways, flipping it facedown, or using tokens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>If an effect or ability gives you a number of uses equal to a trait with a modifier of +0 or less, it grants you 0 uses.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>CLASSES</h1>\n<p>A class is a role-based archetype that determines a PC’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Access to Domains:</strong> Each class grants access to two domains; players choose cards from these domains during character creation and when leveling up.</li>\n<li><strong>Starting Evasion and Hit Points (HP)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Starting Items</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Class Feature(s)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Class Hope Feature:</strong> a class feature that costs 3 Hope to activate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are 9 classes in the Daggerheart core materials: Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, and Wizard.</p>\n<h2>SUBCLASSES</h2>\n<p>Each class is divided into two <strong>subclasses</strong>, each of which further defines and highlights one aspect of its class archetype. Your chosen subclass grants the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spellcast Trait:</strong> the trait used on all Spellcast rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Feature:</strong> a unique starting feature that establishes the identity and strengths of the subclass.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialization Feature:</strong> an advanced feature that can be gained on level up. For some subclasses, the specialization feature grants a new ability; for others, it expands or enhances a feature you already acquired through a class or subclass.</li>\n<li><strong>Mastery Feature:</strong> The mastery feature is a subclass’s most powerful feature, which can be gained at higher levels. For some subclasses, the mastery feature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for others, it’s the impressive culmination of their subclass’s core feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Daggerheart core set includes cards detailing each foundation, specialization, and mastery feature. When you acquire one of these features, take its card for use as a reference during play.</p>",

Instead, it refers to the set of physical characteristics humans will recognize from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and individual, though “humanoid” should still provide a useful frame of reference.</p>\n<p>The core ruleset includes the following ancestries: Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungirl, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simian, and Mixed Ancestry.</p>\n<h4>ANCESTRY FEATURES</h4>\n<p>Each ancestry grants two <strong>ancestry features.</strong> While some features specify the anatomy of any player character of that ancestry’s anatomy, players determine their characters’ physical form.

For example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridized term, such as “goblin-orc.” To describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just “goblin” or just “orc”), or invent a new term, such as “toothling.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Choose Ancestry Features</strong>\n   Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your character’s lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and “Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features because both are the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your character’s heritage might include more than two ancestries, but you still only choose features from two. You can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory.</p>",

The GM responds to these questions by giving the players information their characters could easily obtain, or by asking questions of their own to the players. The players also respond to any questions the GM poses to them. In this way, the table builds out the fiction collaboratively.</p>\n<h2>STEP 3: BUILD ON THE FICTION</h2>\n<p>As the scene develops, the players find opportunities to take action—problems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries to investigate, and so on. The players describe how their characters proceed; if their proposed actions carry no chance of failure (or if failure would be boring), they automatically succeed. But if the outcome of their action is unknown, the GM calls for an action roll. Either way, the table works the outcome into the story and moves the fiction forward, narrating how the PC’s actions have changed things.</p>\n<h2>STEP 4: GO BACK TO STEP 1</h2>\n<p>The process repeats from the beginning, with the GM relaying any updated details or material changes to the players.

Damage is calculated from the <strong>damage roll</strong> listed in the attack’s description with the format “xdy+[modifier]” <em>(e.g., for a spell that inflicts “1d8+2” damage, you roll an eight-sided die and add 2 to the result; the damage dealt is equal to the total).</em></p>\n<p>Any time an effect says to deal damage using your Spellcast trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your Spellcast trait.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>If your Spellcast trait is +0 or lower, you don’t roll anything.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For weapons, the number of damage dice you roll is equal to your <strong>Proficiency</strong>. <em>Note that your Proficiency multiplies the number of dice you roll, but doesn’t affect the modifier. For example, a PC with Proficiency 2 and wielding a weapon with a damage rating of “d8+2” deals damage equal to “2d8+2” on a successful attack.</em></p>\n<p>Successful unarmed attacks inflict [Proficiency]d4 damage.</p>\n<h2>CRITICAL DAMAGE</h2>\n<p>When you get a critical success (i.e., you roll matching values on your Duality Dice) on an attack roll, you deal extra damage. Make the damage roll as usual, but add the maximum possible result of the damage dice to the final total. For instance, if an attack would normally deal 2d8+1 damage, a critical success would deal 2d8+1+16.</p>\n<h2>DAMAGE TYPES</h2>\n<p>There are two damage types: <strong>physical damage (phy)</strong> and <strong>magic damage (mag)</strong>. Unless stated otherwise, mundane weapons and unarmed attacks deal physical damage, and spells deal magic damage.</p>\n<h2>RESISTANCE, IMMUNITY, AND DIRECT DAMAGE</h2>\n<p>If a target has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, they reduce incoming damage of that type by half before comparing it to their Hit Point Thresholds. If the target has additional ways of reducing incoming damage, such as marking Armor Slots, they apply the resistance effect first. The effects of multiple resistances to the same damage type do not stack.</p>\n<p>If a target has <strong>immunity</strong> to a damage type, they ignore incoming damage of that type.</p>\n<p>If an attack deals both physical and magic damage, a character can only benefit from resistance or immunity if they are resistant or immune to both damage types.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct damage</strong> is damage that can’t be reduced by marking Armor Slots.</p>\n<h2>MULTI-TARGET ATTACK ROLLS</h2>\n<p>If a spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries, make one attack roll and one damage roll, then apply the same attack roll result individually.</p>\n<h2>MULTIPLE DAMAGE SOURCES</h2>\n<p>Damage dealt simultaneously from multiple sources is always totaled before it’s compared to its target’s damage thresholds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For example, if a PC with or ancestry makes a successful attack against a target in Melee range and decides to spend a Hope to use their “Tusks” feature (which gives them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the result, then deal that total damage to the adversary.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",

They return to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their marked Hit Points or when the party finishes a long rest. After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die. If its value is equal to or less than your character’s level, they gain a scar; permanently cross out a Hope slot and work with the GM to determine its lasting narrative impact and how, if possible, it can be restored. If you ever cross out your last Hope slot, your character’s journey ends.</p>\n<h2>RISK IT ALL</h2>\n<p>Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher, your character stays on their feet and clears a number of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die (you can divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and Stress however you’d prefer).

    "content": "<p>This section provides additional guidance for preparing and running a session of Daggerheart.</p>\n<h2>STORY BEATS</h2>\n<p>In storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory of the narrative—a shift in the world, a significant action or reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. Take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. When preparing for a session, plan in terms of the moments that give shape to each scene or sequence, rather than pre-scripting specific details or exchanges.</p>\n<h2>PREPARING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS</h2>\n<p>Build the hurdles the PCs face around the question of “What helps tell the story?” Enemies, environments, and hazards are the tools for heightening tension and creating drama. Ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story, revealing the world, the plot, or the characters.</p>\n<h2>BATTLES AND NARRATIVE</h2>\n<p>Dynamic battles create suspense by forcing players to choose between their various objectives, engaging their character’s motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to forge their characters into legendary heroes. When preparing combat encounters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider the narrative function of the battle</li>\n<li>Base adversaries’ moves on their motives</li>\n<li>Use dynamic environments to bring the battleground to life</li>\n<li>Add enemies that can interact with the PCs’ features and special abilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SESSION REWARDS</h2>\n<p>Reward players at the end of a session with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Useful information</li>\n<li>Story hooks</li>\n<li>Loot</li>\n<li>Gold</li>\n<li>Access to new equipment or enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CRAFTING SCENES</h2>\n<p>Whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, tell the players what they need to know by thinking with all of your senses and sharing something unique or unexpected about the fiction.</p>\n<h2>ENGAGING YOUR PLAYERS</h2>\n<p>Keep your players engaged by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rotating the Focus between the PCs</li>\n<li>Tying Together Story Elements</li>\n<li>Engaging Quiet Players</li>\n<li>Using Visual Aids</li>\n<li>Encouraging Unguided Play</li>\n<li>Confronting the PCs with internal and external conflicts</li>\n<li>Raise the Stakes by Spending Fear</li>\n<li>Layering Goals other than Attrition into Combat (see Table of Random Objectives on the next page)</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>1d12</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Objective</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>Acquire (obtain or steal) an important item or items.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>Capture one or more of the opponents.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>Activate a magical device.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Frame a character or tarnish their reputation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Drive the opponent into a corner or ambush point.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Stop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or time-sensitive spell.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td>Hold the line—keep the enemy from reaching a specific area or group.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td>Plant evidence or a tracking device on a target.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>9</strong></td>\n<td>Secure a specific location ahead of another group’s arrival.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>10</strong></td>\n<td>Harass the opponent to deplete their resources or keep them occupied.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>11</strong></td>\n<td>Destroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine, or a weapon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Investigate a situation to confirm or deny existing information.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>PHASED BATTLES</h2>\n<p>Make battles by shifting the nature of its enemies or environment mid-combat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the Terms of Engagement</li>\n<li>Alter the Environment</li>\n<li>Evolve the Opposition</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>USING DOWNTIME</h2>\n<p>Use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.</p>\n<p>Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved.</p>\n<h2>PROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME</h2>\n<p>The Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long-term endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.</p>\n<p>These projects are typically tracked using a Progress Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story.</p>\n<p>Simple projects advance their countdown each time a player uses the Work on a Project move, but complex projects require a roll.</p>\n<h2>EXTENDED DOWNTIME</h2>\n<p>When you fast-forward the story across an extended period, use montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and advance any long-term countdowns as appropriate.</p>",

    "content": "<h2>ROLLING DICE</h2>\n<p>The GM has no Duality Dice; instead, they roll a single d20 called the GM’s Die.</p>\n<h3>ADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS</h3>\n<p>When an adversary attacks a PC, roll your d20 and add the adversary’s attack bonus to the result. If the total meets or beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the attack fails. On a successful attack, roll the attack’s damage dice to determine how much it deals.</p>\n<p>If you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically succeeds and you deal extra damage. Roll damage normally, then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total. For example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat damage modifier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>A critical success on an adversary’s reaction roll automatically succeeds, but confers no additional benefit.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>GUIDANCE ON ACTION ROLLS</h3>\n<p>After a player describes a move they want to make during the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the PC’s Experiences or backstory, the pressure they’re acting under, and the possible outcomes.</li>\n<li>Establish the stakes of an action roll before the player makes it.</li>\n<li>Communicate any unavoidable consequences.</li>\n<li>If desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting outcome, cost, or complication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>MAKING MOVES</h2>\n<p>As the GM, you have <strong>GM moves</strong> that change the story in response to the players’ actions. GM moves aren’t bound by specific spells or effects—when you make a GM move, you can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.</p>\n<p>GM moves happen during <strong>GM turns</strong>. A GM turn begins when the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight passes back to the players.</p>\n<h3>WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE</h3>\n<p>The GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the frequency and severity depends on the type of story you’re telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session you’re running.</p>\n<p>Make a GM move when the players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Roll with Fear</li>\n<li>Fail an action roll</li>\n<li>Do something that has unavoidable consequences</li>\n<li>Give you a “golden opportunity” (an opening that demands an immediate response)</li>\n<li>Look to you for what happens next</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CHOOSING GM MOVES</h3>\n<p>The result of a player’s action roll determines your response:</p>\n<p>On a <strong>Critical Success</strong>, you let the player describe their success, then give them an additional opportunity or advantage.</p>\n<p>On a <strong>Success with Hope</strong>, you let the player describe their success, then you show how the world reacts to it.</p>\n<p>On a <strong>Success with Fear</strong>, you work with the player to describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An adversary attacks</li>\n<li>The PC marks a Stress</li>\n<li>You introduce a new threat</li>\n<li>You raise the stakes of the conflict</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a <strong>Failure with Hope</strong>, you describe how the PC fails to get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An adversary attacks</li>\n<li>The PC marks a Stress</li>\n<li>You introduce a new threat</li>\n<li>You raise the stakes of the conflict</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a <strong>Failure with Fear</strong>, you describe how things go wrong, then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence, complication, or cost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You put them in immediate danger</li>\n<li>They become the focus of multiple adversaries</li>\n<li>They are separated from their party</li>\n<li>They lose an important opportunity for good.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>QUICK REFERENCE: RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS</h3>\n<p><em>If you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick phrases:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Success with Hope:</strong> Yes, and&hellip; (You get what you want and gain a Hope.)</li>\n<li><strong>Success with Fear:</strong> Yes, but&hellip; (You get what you want, but there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)</li>\n<li><strong>Failure with Hope:</strong> No, but&hellip; (Things don’t go as planned, but you gain a Hope.)</li>\n<li><strong>Failure with Fear:</strong> No, and&hellip; (Things don’t go as planned and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, draw inspiration from the “Example GM Moves” list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce a new obstacle or enemy</li>\n<li>Ask the player what happens</li>\n<li>Have the PC mark a Stress</li>\n<li>Tell the players “everything is fine&hellip; for now.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SOFT AND HARD MOVES</h3>\n<p><strong>Soft moves</strong> go easier on the players—they give the party new information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to react to it. <strong>Hard moves</strong> are harsher, more impactful, or more direct—the PCs don’t get an opening to interrupt, alter, or anticipate the outcome.</p>\n<p>Use softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on rolls with Fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example GM Moves</strong></p>\n<p>• Show how the world reacts\n• Ask a question and build on the answer\n• Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive\n• Drive a PC to take action by dangling their goals in front of them\n• Signal an imminent off-screen threat\n• Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger\n• Force the group to split up\n• Make a PC mark Stress\n• Make a move the characters don’t see\n• Show the collateral damage\n• Clear an adversary’s condition\n• Shift the environment\n• Spotlight an adversary\n• Capture someone or something important\n• Use a PC’s backstory against them\n• Take away an opportunity permanently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>USING FEAR</h2>\n<p>You start a campaign with 1 Fear per PC in the party.</p>\n<p>You gain Fear whenever a PC rolls with Fear, the PCs take a rest (see: Downtime), or when an ability or effect tells you to.</p>\n<p>You can never have more than 12 Fear at one time.</p>\n<p>Fear carries over between sessions.</p>\n<p>Spend a Fear to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interrupt the players to steal the spotlight and make a move</li>\n<li>Make an additional GM move</li>\n<li>Use an adversary’s Fear Feature</li>\n<li>Use an environment’s Fear Feature</li>\n<li>Add an adversary’s Experience to a roll</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The dramatic tension of a scene correlates with the amount of Fear you spend during it.

Fear moves often include one or more of these elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their appearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context.</li>\n<li>An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.</li>\n<li>An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the party.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>DIFFICULTY BENCHMARKS</h2>\n<p>The Difficulty of an attack roll against an adversary is equal to the adversary’s Difficulty score. The Difficulty of any other action rolls against an adversary is equal to the adversary’s Difficulty score, plus (if applicable) the value of one of the adversary relevant Experience modifiers.</p>\n<p>When a player makes an action roll without a specified Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty according to the totality of the circumstances.

or impose disadvantage instead of adjusting the Difficulty of an action roll.</p>\n<h3>ADVERSARY ACTION ROLLS</h3>\n<p>By default, adversaries don’t normally make action rolls except for attack rolls and any unique actions described in their stat blocks. Any other action an adversary attempts simply succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversary’s action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant PCs make reaction rolls instead.</p>\n<p>However, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can’t influence, you can give an adversary an <strong>action roll</strong> anyway. For an adversary’s action roll, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or greater than the action’s Difficulty, the action succeeds—otherwise it fails. You can spend a Fear before rolling to add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat block to the total. Use the same procedure when an adversary makes a <strong>reaction roll</strong>.</p>\n<h3>ADVERSARY ADVANTAGE &amp; DISADVANTAGE</h3>\n<p>If an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. If an adversary has disadvantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the lower result.</p>\n<h3>ADVERSARY ATTACKS</h3>\n<p>When an adversary attacks a PC, the GM rolls a d20 and adds the adversary’s Attack Modifier to the result. If the total meets or beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Before rolling, the GM can grant the attacking adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a Fear to add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat block to the total.</p>\n<p>On a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their stat block to the target.</p>\n<p>When an adversary’s action lets the GM make an <strong>attack against multiple targets</strong>, they make one attack roll and compare it to each target’s Evasion separately.</p>\n<h2>COUNTDOWNS</h2>\n<p><strong>Countdowns</strong> represent a period of time or series of events preceding a future effect. A countdown begins at a starting value. When a countdown <strong>advances</strong>, it’s reduced by 1. The countdown’s effect is triggered when the countdown reaches 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: You can track countdowns by “spinning down” dice or ticking off boxes.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Standard countdowns</strong> advance every time a player makes an action roll. If an adversary or environment ability refers to a “Countdown [n],” then it means a standard countdown with a starting value of n.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic countdowns</strong> advance by up to 3 depending on the outcomes of action rolls. <strong>Consequence countdowns</strong> are dynamic countdowns to negative effects. <strong>Progress countdowns</strong> are dynamic countdowns to positive effects. Dynamic countdowns advance according to this chart:</p>\n<h2>DYNAMIC COUNTDOWN ADVANCEMENT</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Roll Result</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Progress Advancement</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Consequence Advancement</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure with Fear</td>\n<td>No advancement</td>\n<td>Tick down 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure with Hope</td>\n<td>No advancement</td>\n<td>Tick down 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Success with Fear</td>\n<td>Tick down 1</td>\n<td>Tick down 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Success with Hope</td>\n<td>Tick down 2</td>\n<td>No advancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical Success</td>\n<td>Tick down 3</td>\n<td>No advancement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>ADVANCED COUNTDOWN FEATURES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Countdowns with <strong>randomized starting values.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Loop countdowns</strong> that reset to their starting value after their countdown effect is triggered.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing</strong> countdowns that increase their starting value by 1 every time they loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Decreasing</strong> countdowns that decrease their starting value by 1 every time they loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Linked</strong> progress and consequence countdowns that simultaneously advance according to the same action roll outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Long-term countdowns</strong> that advance after <strong>rests</strong> instead of action rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>GIVING OUT GOLD, EQUIPMENT, AND LOOT</h2>\n<p>It’s up to you and your players how much importance you want to place on gold, equipment, and loot in your campaign.</p>\n<p>Adjust the availability and utility of wealth and equipment to reflect the tone, themes, and setting of your campaign.</p>\n<p>If you don’t wish to track gold, then when PCs go shopping for new items let them pick one or two from a short, preselected list that aligns with your campaign setting and the party’s current location.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, set the prices of goods and services by adjusting the entries in the Average Costs table to reflect your campaign setting:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Meals for a party of adventurers per night</td>\n<td>1 Handful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard inn room per night</td>\n<td>1 Handful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luxury inn room per night</td>\n<td>1 Bag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carriage ride</td>\n<td>2 Handfuls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount (horse, mule, etc.)</td>\n<td>3 Bags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Specialized tools</td>\n<td>3 Handfuls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fine clothing</td>\n<td>3 Handfuls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luxury clothing</td>\n<td>1 Bag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tier 1 equipment (weapons, armor)</td>\n<td>1–5 Handfuls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tier 2 equipment (weapons, armor)</td>\n<td>1–2 Bags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tier 3 equipment (weapons, armor)</td>\n<td>5–10 Bags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tier 4 equipment (weapons, armor)</td>\n<td>1–2 Chests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>RUNNING GM NPCS</h2>\n<p>When you run NPCs as the GM, you should always strive to follow your GM principles and use them to bring the world to life. Differentiate NPCs with unique manners of speech and action; let their individual goals and desires motivate their actions.</p>\n<p>The only essential elements for a NPC are their <strong>name</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, and <strong>motive</strong>. If it’s likely that the PCs will roll actions against them, give them a <strong>Difficulty</strong>. Adversaries can be invented or improvised by modifying the stat block of another adversary.</p>\n<p>If an NPC becomes an ally in combat, they don’t need a stat block—just put the spotlight on what they do and show how their involvement alters the fiction. If a PC capitalizes on their help during the scene, give the PC advantage. NPCs that don’t have Hit Points or Stress can still be injured or killed if the fiction demands it.</p>\n<p>If you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with the system, you can give them one or more features with specific <strong>triggers</strong> and <strong>effects</strong>. An NPC might also have a choice that adjusts the parameters of their feature. For example:</p>\n<h2>NPC FEATURE EXAMPLES</h2>\n<h3>ARCANE HOLD</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Choice:</em></strong> When the battle begins, choose a favored PC.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Trigger:</em></strong> The first time during a battle the favored PC is within Close range and hit with an attack.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong> Make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against the adversary. On a success, the target is temporarily Restrained by tendrils of powerful magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>VOLLEY OF ARROWS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Trigger:</em></strong> A battle begins and this NPC is involved.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong> Activate a countdown (Loop 3). It ticks down when a PC misses an attack. When it triggers, this NPC releases a volley of arrows at a target of the PCs’ choice, dealing 2d8+3 physical damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MENTOR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Choice:</em></strong> When the battle begins, choose a protégé PC.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Trigger:</em></strong> Your protégé is within Close range and fails an attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong> Move into Melee range with the PC and give them advice or guidance. The next attack roll they make has advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>REGROUP</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Choice:</em></strong> When a battle begins, choose a point within Far range.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Trigger:</em></strong> All PCs have marked all of their Armor Slots.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong> Teleport all PCs and this NPC to the chosen spot and clear an Armor Slot on each target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>INTO THE NIGHT</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Trigger:</em></strong> The PCs start a long rest with this NPC.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong> Roll 1d4. On a 2 or less, this NPC steals 1 handful of gold from the party while they are sleeping, then disappears into the night.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>OPTIONAL GM MECHANICS</h2>\n<h3>FATE ROLLS</h3>\n<p>When the GM wants to leave an outcome entirely up to chance, they call for a fate roll. The GM establishes what’s at stake and how the roll will be interpreted. Then a player rolls one of their Duality Dice and interprets the result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Examples:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“Roll your Fear Die. On a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond this house.”</em></li>\n<li><em>“I think it’s really up to chance whether reinforcements will make it to you in time. Go ahead and roll your Fear Die—that’ll determine the starting size of the countdown. When that triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your Far range.”</em></li>\n<li><em>“Go ahead and roll your Hope Die to see how big the crowd at the inn is tonight. The higher the roll, the bigger the crowd.”</em></li>\n<li><em>“Make a roll using your Hope Die to determine the number of Stamina Potions the shop has in stock.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>FALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE</h3>\n<p>If a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage.</li>\n<li>A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.</li>\n<li>A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death at the GM’s discretion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.</p>\n<h3>MOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER</h3>\n<p>By default, attack rolls made while the attacker is underwater have disadvantage.</p>\n<p>For creatures that can’t breathe underwater, use a standard countdown (3) to track how long they can hold their breath. Advance the countdown whenever the PC takes an action. In addition if they fail a roll or roll with Fear while underwater, you can spend your GM move to advance it an additional time—or twice, if they rolled a failure with Fear.</p>\n<p>Once the countdown ends, the underwater PC must mark a Stress whenever they take an action.</p>\n<h3>CONFLICT BETWEEN PLAYERS</h3>\n<p>Sometimes a player might want their character to act against another PC in the scene. Before resorting to rolling dice, discuss the situation with both players to decide how to resolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach an outcome—but if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate the scene according to the results.</p>\n<p>On an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the defender’s Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target makes a reaction roll. To succeed, the instigator must beat a Difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Any time a character does something to advance the story, such as speaking with another character, interacting with the environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a class feature, they are making a move.</p>\n<h2>ACTION ROLLS</h2>\n<p>Any move where success would be trivial or failure would be boring automatically succeeds, but any move that’s difficult to accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an <strong>action roll</strong>.</p>\n<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>\n<p>All action rolls require a pair of d12s called <strong>Duality Dice</strong>. These are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die representing Hope and the other representing Fear.</p>\n<p>To make an action roll, you roll the Duality Dice, sum the results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to a Difficulty number to determine the outcome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Success with Hope:</strong> If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a “Success with Hope.” You succeed and gain a Hope.</li>\n<li><strong>Success with Fear:</strong> If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a “Success with Fear.” You succeed with a cost or complication, but the GM gains a Fear.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure with Hope:</strong> If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a “Failure with Hope.” You fail with a minor consequence and gain a Hope, then the spotlight swings to the GM.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure with Fear:</strong> If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a “Failure with Fear.” You fail with a major consequence and the GM gains a Fear, then the spotlight swings to the GM.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Success:</strong> If the Duality Dice show matching results, you rolled a “Critical Success” (“Crit”). You automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a Hope, and clear a Stress. If this was an attack roll, you deal critical damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>A Critical Success counts as a roll “with Hope.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After resolving the action roll, the table works together to weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues.</p>\n<h2>FAILING FORWARD</h2>\n<p>In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where “nothing happens,” because the fiction constantly evolves based on the successes and failures of the characters.</p>\n<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>\n<p>The following steps describe in more detail the procedure that all action rolls utilize:</p>\n<h3>STEP 1: PICK AN APPROPRIATE TRAIT</h3>\n<p>Some actions and effects specify in their description which trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the GM tells the acting player which character trait best applies to the action being attempted. If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the GM chooses or lets the acting player decide.</p>\n<h3>STEP 2: DETERMINE THE DIFFICULTY</h3>\n<p>Some actions and features say in their description what the Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should communicate the potential consequences of failure to the acting player.</p>\n<h3>STEP 3: APPLY EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS</h3>\n<p>The acting player decides whether to Utilize an Experience or activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice pool.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra dice, or other modifiers before the roll.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>STEP 4: ROLL THE DICE</h3>\n<p>The acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces the results in the format of “[total result] with [Hope/Fear]”—or “Critical Success!” in the case of matching Duality Dice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> <em>A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their Fear Die, then announce “I rolled a 13 with Fear!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>STEP 5: RESOLVE THE OUTCOME</h3>\n<p>The active player and the GM work together, along with the suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the outcome of the action.</p>\n<h2>GM MOVES AND ADVERSARY ACTIONS</h2>\n<p>GMs also make moves. They should consider making a move when a player does one of the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rolls with Fear on an action roll.</li>\n<li>Fails an action roll.</li>\n<li>Does something that would have consequences.</li>\n<li>Gives them a golden opportunity.</li>\n<li>Looks to them for what happens next.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the GM turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the PCs.</p>\n<p>Many adversaries and environments have <strong>Fear features</strong>, especially powerful or consequential moves that the GM must spend Fear to activate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>This Fear is in addition to any Fear the GM has previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another action or ability.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ADVERSARY ACTIONS</h2>\n<p>When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a GM move to spotlight an adversary. A spotlighted adversary can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move within Close range and make a standard attack</li>\n<li>Move within Close range and use an adversary action</li>\n<li>Clear a condition</li>\n<li>Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield</li>\n<li>Do anything else the fiction demands or the GM deems appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GM can spend additional Fear to spotlight additional adversaries. Once the GM has finished, the spotlight swings back to the PCs.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ROLLS</h2>\n<p>Some rolls have unique specifications or otherwise modify the action roll procedure: trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls, attack rolls, and damage rolls. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply any bonus, modifier, or effect to a special roll as if it were a standard action roll.</p>\n<h3>TRAIT ROLLS</h3>\n<p>An action roll that specifies which character trait applies to it is called a <strong>trait roll</strong>. In the text of a feature or effect, a trait roll is referenced with the format “[Trait] Roll (Difficulty)” (e.g., “Agility Roll (12)”). If the text of an effect doesn’t specify a trait roll’s Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty based on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Features and effects that affect a trait roll also affect any action roll that uses the same trait, including attack rolls, Spellcast rolls, and standard action rolls.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> <em>The katari’s ancestry feature “Feline Instincts,” which allows the katari to reroll an Agility Roll, can also be used on a standard action roll using Agility to traverse dangerous terrain or on an attack roll made with a weapon that uses Agility.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>SPELLCAST ROLLS</h3>\n<p><strong>Spellcast Rolls</strong> are trait rolls that require you to use your Spellcast trait. Your Spellcast trait, if you have one, is determined by your subclass.</p>\n<p>Spellcast Rolls are only made when a character uses a feature that requires one. A successful Spellcast Roll activates the effect as described by the feature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>A Spellcast Roll that can damage a target is also considered an attack roll.</em></p>\n<p><em>When you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect ends. The GM can spend a Fear to end a temporary effect. If your spell doesn’t specify when it ends, it ends when you choose or at a natural moment of the story. You can choose to end your spell early.</em></p>\n<p><em>You can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell at the same time.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>REACTION ROLLS</h3>\n<p>A <strong>reaction roll</strong> is made in response to an attack or a hazard, representing a character’s attempt to avoid or withstand an imminent effect.</p>\n<p>Reaction rolls work like action rolls, except they don’t generate Hope or Fear, don’t trigger additional GM moves, and other characters can’t aid you with Help an Ally.</p>\n<p>If you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you don’t clear a Stress or gain a Hope, but you do ignore any effects that would have impacted you on a success, such as taking damage or marking Stress.</p>\n<h3>GROUP ACTION ROLLS</h3>\n<p>When multiple PCs take action together, the party chooses one PC to <strong>lead the action</strong>. Each other player then describes how their character collaborates on the task. The leader makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make reaction rolls using whichever traits they and the GM decide fit best.</p>\n<p>The lead character gains a +1 bonus to their lead action roll for each of these reaction rolls that succeeded and a –1 penalty for each these reaction rolls that failed.</p>\n<h3>TAG TEAM ROLLS</h3>\n<p>Each player can, once per session, initiate a <strong>Tag Team Roll</strong> between their character and another PC by spending 3 Hope. The players work with one another to describe how they combine their actions in a unique and exciting way. Both players make separate action rolls; before resolving the roll’s outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions. On a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with Fear, the GM gains a Fear token for each PC involved.</p>\n<p>On a successful Tag Team attack roll, both players roll damage and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt, which is resolved as if it came from a single source. If the attacks deal different types of damage, the players choose which type to deal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the purposes of any countdowns or features that track action rolls.</em></p>\n<p><em>Though each player may only initiate one Tag Team Roll per session, one PC can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ADVANTAGE &amp; DISADVANTAGE</h2>\n<p>Some features and effects let you roll with advantage or disadvantage on an action or reaction roll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advantage</strong> represents an opportunity that you seize to increase your chances of success. When you roll with advantage, you roll a d6 advantage die with your dice pool and add its result to your total.</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong> represents an additional difficulty, hardship, or challenge you face when attempting an action. When you roll with disadvantage, you roll a d6 disadvantage die with your dice pool and subtract its result from your total.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advantage or disadvantage can be granted or imposed by mechanical triggers or at the GM’s discretion. When a PC aids you with Help an Ally, they roll their own advantage die and you add it to your total.</p>\n<p>Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for-one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so you’ll never roll both at the same time. If you have advantage or disadvantage from other sources that don’t affect your own dice pool, such as another player’s Help an Ally move, their effects stack with your rolled results.</p>\n<h2>HOPE &amp; FEAR</h2>\n<p><strong>Hope</strong> and <strong>Fear</strong> are metacurrencies representing the cosmic forces that shape the events of your table’s story. Hope powers PC abilities and features, while Fear powers the abilities of the GM and the adversaries and environments they control.</p>\n<h3>HOPE</h3>\n<p>Every PC starts with 2 Hope at character creation and gains more throughout play. A PC can have a maximum of 6 Hope at one time, and Hope carries over between sessions.</p>\n<p>Players can spend Hope to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Help an Ally</strong><br />\n  When you Help an Ally who is making an action roll, describe how you do so and roll an advantage die. Multiple players can spend Hope to help the same acting player, but that player only adds the highest result to their final total.</li>\n<li><strong>Utilize an Experience</strong><br />\n  When you Utilize an Experience on a relevant roll, add its modifier to the result. You can spend multiple Hope to utilize multiple Experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiate a Tag Team Roll</strong><br />\n  Spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team roll, combining the actions of two PCs into one impressive act of synergy. When you make a Tag Team roll, both players roll their own rolls and choose which set of results to apply to the outcome.</li>\n<li><strong>Activate a Hope Feature</strong><br />\n  A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to spend a specified amount of Hope to activate it. Class Hope features are class-specific features, detailed on your character sheet, that cost 3 Hope to activate.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple Hope).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>FEAR</h3>\n<p>The GM gains Fear whenever a player rolls with Fear and can spend Fear at any time to make or enhance a GM move or to use a Fear Feature. The GM can have up to 12 Fear at one time. Fear carries over between sessions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Though Daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking, maneuvering, and taking damage.</p>\n<h2>EVASION</h2>\n<p><strong>Evasion</strong> represents a character’s ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a Difficulty equal to the target’s Evasion. A PC’s Base Evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>attacks rolled against adversaries use the target’s Difficulty instead of Evasion.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>HIT POINTS &amp; DAMAGE THRESHOLDS</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong> represent a character’s ability to withstand physical injury. When a character takes damage, they mark 1 to 3 HP, based on their <strong>damage thresholds</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the final damage is at or above the character’s Severe damage threshold, they mark 3 HP.</li>\n<li>If the final damage is at or above the character’s Major damage threshold but below their Severe damage threshold, they mark 2 HP.</li>\n<li>If the final damage is below the character’s Major damage threshold, they mark 1 HP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no HP is marked.</p>\n<p>A PC’s damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor. A PC’s starting HP is based on their class, but they can gain additional Hit Points through advancements, features, and other effects.</p>\n<p>An adversary’s Damage Thresholds and HP are listed in their stat blocks.</p>\n<p>When a character marks their last Hit Point, they fall. If a PC falls, they make a death move.</p>\n<p>Characters can clear Hit Points by taking downtime moves (see: Downtime) or by activating relevant special abilities or effects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Optional Rule: Massive Damage</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>If a character ever takes damage equal to twice their Severe threshold, they mark 4 HP instead of 3.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",

Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in or affect the game through roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the things their PC is able to do and which actions they’re more (or less) likely to succeed at when making moves and taking action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>You can fill in your character’s name, pronouns, and Character Description details at any point of the character creation process.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>STEP 1: CHOOSE A CLASS AND SUBCLASS</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"Classes.md\">Classes</a></strong> are role-based archetypes that determine which class features and <strong>domain cards</strong> a PC gains access to throughout the campaign. There are nine classes in this SRD: Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, Wizard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select a class and take its corresponding <strong>character sheet</strong> and <strong>character guide</strong> printouts. These sheets are for recording your PC’s details; you’ll update and reference them throughout the campaign.</li>\n<li>Every class begins with one or more unique <strong>class feature(s)</strong>, described in the front of each class’s character sheet. If your class feature prompts you to make a selection, do so now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Subclasses</strong> further refine a class archetype and reinforce its expression by granting access to unique <strong>subclass features</strong>. Each class comprises two subclasses. Select one of your class’s subclasses and take its <strong>Foundation</strong> card.</p>\n<h2>STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR HERITAGE</h2>\n<p>Your character’s <strong>heritage</strong> combines two elements: <strong><a href=\"Ancestries.md\">ancestry</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"Communities.md\">community</a></strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A character’s <strong>ancestry</strong> reflects their lineage, impacting their physicality and granting them two unique <strong>ancestry features</strong>. Take the card for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungirl, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simian. To create a Mixed Ancestry, take the top (first-listed) ancestry feature from one ancestry and the bottom (second-listed) ancestry feature from another.</li>\n<li>Your character’s <strong>community</strong> represents their culture or environment of origin and grants them a <strong>community feature</strong>. Take the card for one of the following communities, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, Ridgeborne, Seaborne, Skyborne, Underborne, Wanderborne, Wildborne.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>STEP 3: ASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS</h2>\n<p>Your character has six traits that represent their physical, mental, and social aptitude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agility</strong> (Use it to Sprint, Leap, Maneuver, etc.)<br />\n  A high Agility means you’re fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You’ll make an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop.</li>\n<li><strong>Strength</strong> (Use it to Lift, Smash, Grapple, etc.)<br />\n  A high Strength means you’re better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. You’ll make a Strength Roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe.</li>\n<li><strong>Finesse</strong> (Use it to Control, Hide, Tinker, etc.)<br />\n  A high Finesse means you’re skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You’ll make a Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision.</li>\n<li><strong>Instinct</strong> (Use it to Perceive, Sense, Navigate, etc.)<br />\n  A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. You’ll make an Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe.</li>\n<li><strong>Presence</strong> (Use it to Charm, Perform, Deceive, etc.)<br />\n  A high Presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. You’ll make a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd.</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge</strong> (Use it to Recall, Analyze, Comprehend, etc.)<br />\n  A high Knowledge means you know information others don’t and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. You’ll make a Knowledge Roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you “roll with a trait,” that trait’s modifier is added to the roll’s total. Assign the modifiers +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1 to your character’s traits in any order you wish.</p>\n<h2>STEP 4: RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARACTER INFORMATION</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Characters start a new campaign at <strong>Level 1</strong>. Record your level in the designated space at the top of your character sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Evasion</strong> represents your character’s ability to avoid damage. Your character’s starting Evasion is determined by their class and appears directly beneath the Evasion field on your character sheet; copy this number into the Evasion field.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong> are an abstract measure of your physical health. Your starting HP is determined by your class and is recorded on your character sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Stress</strong> reflects your ability to withstand the mental and emotional strain of dangerous situations and physical exertion. Every PC starts with 6 Stress slots.</li>\n<li><strong>Hope</strong> is a metacurrency that fuels special moves and certain abilities or features. All PCs start with 2 Hope; mark these in the Hope field of your character sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>STEP 5: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING EQUIPMENT</h2>\n<p>Choose your <strong><a href=\"Weapons.md\">weapon(s)</a></strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select from the Tier 1 Weapon Tables. Either a <strong>two-handed primary weapon</strong> or a <strong>one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon</strong>. Then equip your selection by recording it in the Active Weapon field of your character sheet.</li>\n<li>At Level 1, your <strong>Proficiency</strong> is 1; write this number in the Proficiency field on your character sheet, then calculate and record your <strong>damage roll</strong> by combining your Proficiency value with your equipped weapon(s) <strong>damage dice.</strong> <em>Example: If your Proficiency is 1 and your weapon’s damage dice is d6+1, your damage roll is 1d6+1. Proficiency only determines how many damage dice you roll, and does not affect any flat damage modifiers.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose and equip one set of <strong><a href=\"Armor.md\">armor</a></strong> from the Tier 1 Armor Table, then record its details in the <strong>Active Armor</strong> field of your character sheet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add your character’s level to your equipped armor’s <strong>Base Score</strong> and record the total for both numbers in the corresponding fields. At character creation, your level is 1.</li>\n<li>Record your <strong>Armor Score</strong> in the field at the top left of your character sheet. Your Armor Score is equal to your equipped armor’s <strong>Base Score</strong> plus any permanent bonuses your character has to their Armor Score from other abilities, features, or effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add the following items to the <strong>Inventory</strong> fields on your character sheet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, and a handful of gold (mark one box in the left-hand column of your character sheet titled “Gold &gt; Handfuls”)</li>\n<li>EITHER a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit Points) OR a Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)</li>\n<li>One of the class-specific items listed on your character guide</li>\n<li>If applicable, whichever class-specific item you selected to carry your spells</li>\n<li>Any other GM-approved items you’d like to have at the start of the game</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>STEP 6: CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Develop your character’s <strong>background</strong> by answering the <strong>background questions</strong> in your character guide, modifying or replacing them if they don’t fit the character you want to play.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Your background has no explicit mechanical effect, but it greatly affects the character you’ll play and the prep the GM will do. Throughout character creation, you can adjust choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this background as your character takes shape. If you wish, you can leave your character’s past more ambiguous for the time being and discover their backstory through play.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>STEP 7: CREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES</h2>\n<p>An Experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills, personality traits, or aptitudes your character has acquired over the course of their life. When your PC makes a move, they can spend a Hope to add a relevant Experience’s modifier to an action or reaction roll.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your PC gets two Experiences at character creation, each with a +2 modifier.</li>\n<li>There’s no set list of Experiences to choose from, but an Experience can’t be too broadly applicable and it can’t grant your character specific mechanical benefits, such as magic spells or special abilities. <em>For example, “Lucky” and “Highly Skilled” are too broad because they could apply to virtually any roll. Likewise, “Supersonic Flight” and “Invulnerable” imply game-breaking special abilities.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Backgrounds:</strong> <em>Assassin, Blacksmith, Bodyguard, Bounty Hunter, Chef to the Royal Family, Circus Performer, Con Artist, Fallen Monarch, Field Medic, High Priestess, Merchant, Noble, Pirate, Politician, Runaway, Scholar, Sellsword, Soldier, Storyteller, Thief, World Traveler</em></p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> <em>Affable, Battle-Hardened, Bookworm, Charming, Cowardly, Friend to All, Helpful, Intimidating Presence, Leader, Lone Wolf, Loyal, Observant, Prankster, Silver Tongue, Sticky Fingers, Stubborn to a Fault, Survivor, Young and Naive</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialties:</strong> <em>Acrobat, Gambler, Healer, Inventor, Magical Historian, Mapmaker, Master of Disguise, Navigator, Sharpshooter, Survivalist, Suashbuckler, Tactician</em></p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> <em>Animal Whisperer, Barter, Deadly Aim, Fast Learner, Incredible Strength, Liar, Light Feet, Negotiator, Photographic Memory, Quick Hands, Repair, Scavenger, Tracker</em></p>\n<p><strong>Phrases:</strong> <em>Catch Me If You Can, Fake It Till You Make It, First Time’s the Charm, Hold the Line, I Won’t Let You Down, I’ll Catch You, I’ve Got Your Back, Knowledge Is Power, Nature’s Friend, Never Again, No One Left Behind, Pick on Someone Your Own Size, The Show Must Go On, This Is Not a Negotiation, Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>STEP 8: CHOOSE DOMAIN CARDS</h2>\n<p>Your class has access to two of the nine <a href=\"Domains.md\">Domains</a> included in the core set. Choose two cards from your class’s domains, which are listed in the upper left of your character sheet. You can take one card from each domain or two from a single domain, whichever you prefer.</p>\n<h2>STEP 9: CREATE YOUR CONNECTIONS</h2>\n<p>Connections are the relationships between the PCs. To create connections, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go around the table and have each player describe their characters to one another—at a minimum, their name, pronouns, character description, experiences, and the answers to their background questions.</li>\n<li>Discuss potential connections between the PCs using the questions included in the “Connections” section of your character guide as inspiration.</li>\n<li>Suggest at least one connection between your character and each other player’s PC. Accept any suggested connections you want to explore, reject any you don’t.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>A player can reject a suggested connection for any reason, and it’s okay if there isn’t an established connection between every pair of PCs—you can always discover and develop those relationships through play.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",

This sheet is for tracking important information about your character’s companion and can be tucked beneath the right side of your character sheet for ease of viewing.</p>\n<h3>STEP 1: NAME YOUR COMPANION</h3>\n<p>Work with the GM to decide what kind of animal you have as your companion. Give them a name and add a picture of them to the companion sheet.</p>\n<h3>STEP 2: WRITE THEIR EVASION</h3>\n<p>Fill in their Evasion, which starts at 10.</p>\n<h3>STEP 3: CHOOSE THEIR COMPANION EXPERIENCE</h3>\n<p>Create two Experiences for your companion based on their training and the history you have together.</p>\n<p>Start with +2 in both Experiences. Whenever you gain a new Experience, your companion also gains one. All new Experiences start at +2.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example Companion Experiences:</strong> <em>Expert Climber, Fetch, Friendly, Guardian of the Forest, Horrifying, Intimidating, Loyal Until the End, Navigation, Nimble, Nobody Left Behind, On High Alert, Protector, Playful Companion, Scout, Seize Animal, Trusted Mount, Vigilant, We Always Find Them, You Can’t Hit What You Can’t Find</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>STEP 4: CHOOSE THEIR ATTACK AND RECORD DAMAGE DIE</h3>\n<p>Finally, describe your companion’s method of dealing damage (their standard attack) and record it in the “Attack &amp; Damage” section. At level 1, your companion’s damage die is a d6 and their range is Melee.</p>\n<h2>WORKING WITH YOUR COMPANION</h2>\n<p>The following sections will run you through the basics of working with your companion.</p>\n<h3>USING SPELLCAST ROLLS, HOPE, AND EXPERIENCES</h3>\n<p>Make a Spellcast Roll to connect with your companion and command them to take action. Spend a Hope to add an applicable Companion Experience to the roll. On a success with Hope, if your next action builds on their success, you gain advantage on the roll.</p>\n<h3>ATTACKING WITH YOUR COMPANION</h3>\n<p>When you command your companion to attack, they gain any benefits that would normally only apply to you (such as the effects of “Ranger’s Focus”). On a success, their damage roll uses your Proficiency and their damage die.</p>\n<h3>TAKING DAMAGE AS STRESS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When your companion would take any amount of damage, they mark a Stress. When they mark their last Stress, they drop out of the scene (by hiding, fleeing, or a similar action). They remain unavailable until the start of your next long rest, where they return with 1 Stress cleared.</li>\n<li>When you choose a downtime move that clears Stress on yourself, your companion clears an equal number of Stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>LEVELING UP YOUR COMPANION</h2>\n<p>When your character levels up, choose one available option for your companion from the following list and mark it on your sheet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intelligent:</strong> Your companion gains a permanent +1 bonus to a Companion Experience of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Light in the Dark:</strong> Use this as an additional Hope slot your character can mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Creature Comfort:</strong> Once per rest, when you take time during a quiet moment to give your companion love and attention, you can gain a Hope or you can both clear a Stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Armored:</strong> When your companion takes damage, you can mark one of your Armor Slots instead of marking one of their Stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Vicious:</strong> Increase your companion’s damage die or range by one step (d6 to d8, Close to Far, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Resilient:</strong> Your companion gains an additional Stress slot.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonded:</strong> When you mark your last Hit Point, your companion rushes to your side to comfort you. Roll a number of d6s equal to the unmarked Stress slots they have and mark them. If any roll a 6, your companion helps you up. Clear your last Hit Point and return to the scene.</li>\n<li><strong>Aware:</strong> Your companion gains a permanent +2 bonus to their Evasion.</li>\n</ul>",

You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wildtouch:</em></strong> You can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve nature—such as causing a flower to rapidly grow, summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfire—at will.</p>\n<h2>DRUID SUBCLASSES</h2>\n<p>Choose either the <strong><a href=\"../subclasses/Warden%20of%20the%20Elements.md\">Warden of the Elements</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"../subclasses/Warden%20of%20Renewal.md\">Warden of Renewal</a></strong> subclass.</p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND QUESTIONS</h2>\n<p><em>Answer any of the following background questions.

At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.</p>\n<p>Beastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creature Category:</strong> Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).</li>\n<li><strong>Character Trait:</strong> While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Attack Rolls:</strong> When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Evasion:</strong> While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.</li>\n<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TIER 1</h2>\n<h3>AGILE SCOUT</h3>\n<p>(Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> deceive, locate, sneak</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Agile:</em></strong> Your movement is silent, and you can spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fragile:</em></strong> When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.</p>\n<h3>HOUSEHOLD FRIEND</h3>\n<p>(Cat, Dog, Rabbit, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instinct +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Instinct d6 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> climb, locate, protect</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Companion:</em></strong> When you Help an Ally, you can roll a d8 as your advantage die.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fragile:</em></strong> When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.</p>\n<h3>NIMBLE GRAZER</h3>\n<p>(Deer, Gazelle, Goat, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agility +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Agility d6 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> leap, sneak, sprint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Elusive Prey:</em></strong> When an attack roll against you would succeed, you can mark a Stress and roll a d4.

A Poisoned creature takes 1d10 direct physical damage each time they act.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Webslinger:</em></strong> You can create a strong web material useful for both adventuring and battle. The web is resilient enough to support one creature. You can temporarily Restrain a target within Close range by succeeding on a Finesse Roll against them.</p>\n<h3>MIGHTY STRIDER</h3>\n<p>(Camel, Horse, Zebra, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d8+1 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> leap, navigate, sprint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Carrier:</em></strong> You can carry up to two willing allies with you when you move.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Trample:</em></strong> Mark a Stress to move up to Close range in a straight line and make an attack against all targets within Melee range of the line. Targets you succeed against take d8+1 physical damage using your Proficiency and are temporarily Vulnerable.</p>\n<h2>TIER 2</h2>\n<h3>ARMORED SENTRY</h3>\n<p>(Armadillo, Pangolin, Turtle, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strength +1 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d8+2 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> dig, locate, protect</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Armored Shell:</em></strong> Your hardened exterior gives you resistance to physical damage. Additionally, mark an Armor slot to retract into your shell. While in your shell, physical damage is reduced by a number equal to your Armor Score (after applying resistance), but you can&rsquo;t perform other actions without leaving this form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cannonball:</em></strong> Mark a Stress to allow an ally to throw or launch you at an adversary. To do so, the ally makes an attack roll using Agility or Strength (their choice) against a target within Close Range. On a success, the adversary takes d12+2 physical damage using the thrower’s Proficiency. You can spend a Hope to target an additional adversary within Very Close range of the first. The second target takes half the damage dealt to the first target.</p>\n<h3>POWERFUL BEAST</h3>\n<p>(Bear, Bull, Moose, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strength +3 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d10+4 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> navigate, protect, scare</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Rampage:</em></strong> When you roll a 1 on a damage die, you can roll a d10 and add the result to the damage roll. Additionally, before you make an attack roll, you can mark a Stress to gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency for that attack.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Thick Hide:</em></strong> You gain a +2 bonus to your damage thresholds.</p>\n<h3>STRIKING SERPENT</h3>\n<p>(Cobra, Rattlesnake, Viper, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finesse +1 | Evasion +2 | Very Close Finesse d8+4 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> climb, deceive, sprint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Venomous Strike:</em></strong> Make an attack against any number of targets within Very Close range. On a success, a target is temporarily Poisoned. A Poisoned creature takes 1d10 direct physical damage each time they act.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Warning Hiss:</em></strong> Mark a Stress to force any number of targets within Melee range to move back to Very Close range.</p>\n<h3>POUNCING PREDATOR</h3>\n<p>(Cheetah, Lion, Panther, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instinct +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Instinct d8+6 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> attack, climb, sneak</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Fleet:</em></strong> Spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Takedown:</em></strong> Mark a Stress to move into Melee range of a target and make an attack roll against them. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to your Proficiency for this attack and the target must mark a Stress.</p>\n<h3>WINGED BEAST</h3>\n<p>(Hawk, Owl, Raven, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finesse +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Finesse d4+2 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> deceive, locate, scare</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bird’s-Eye View:</em></strong> You can fly at will. Once per rest while you are airborne, you can ask the GM a question about the scene below you without needing to roll. The first time a character makes a roll to act on this information, they gain advantage on the roll.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hollow Bones:</em></strong> You gain a -2 penalty to your damage thresholds.</p>\n<h2>TIER 3</h2>\n<h3>GREAT PREDATOR</h3>\n<p>(Dire Wolf, Velociraptor, Sabertooth Tiger, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strength +2 | Evasion +2 | Melee Strength d12+8 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> attack, sneak, sprint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Carrier:</em></strong> You can carry up to two willing allies with you when you move.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vicious Maul:</em></strong> When you succeed on an attack against a target, you can spend a Hope to make them temporarily Vulnerable and gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency for this attack.</p>\n<h3>MIGHTY LIZARD</h3>\n<p>(Alligator, Crocodile, Gila Monster, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instinct +2 | Evasion +1 | Melee Instinct d10+7 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> attack, sneak, track</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Physical Defense:</em></strong> You gain a +3 bonus to your damage thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Snapping Strike:</em></strong> When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, you can spend a Hope to clamp that opponent in your jaws, making them temporarily Restrained and Vulnerable.</p>\n<h3>GREAT WINGED BEAST</h3>\n<p>(Giant Eagle, Falcon, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finesse +2 | Evasion +3 | Melee Finesse d8+6 phy<br />\n<strong>Gain advantage on:</strong> deceive, distract, locate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bird’s-Eye View:</em></strong> You can fly at will.

The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors’ wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts.</p>\n<p><strong>Haven</strong> was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase “The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as <strong>Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid</strong>. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Haven’s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.</p>\n<p>But Shun’Aush would have his revenge. As the Haventies carved his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague.</p>\n<p>Over the last two years, over half of Haven’s populace fell to a disease known as the <strong>Serpent’s Sickness</strong>. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens—first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, “the serpent” moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.</p>\n<p>When High Magus of Haven, <strong>Archmage Phylax</strong>, discovered a rare red flower called the Crimson Bud is the only well that could cure the Serpent’s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the spring—but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.</p>\n<p>Desperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the <strong>Reaping Eye</strong> from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: <strong>The Great Owl Nikta</strong>, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasons—of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the <strong>Sowing Eye</strong>, forcing the land into everlasting spring.</p>\n<p>In the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the <strong>Witherwild</strong>—Fanewick’s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Serpent’s Sickness and the Shepherd’s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a response, even the unprepared—and unwilling—must make a stand.</p>\n<h2>COMMUNITIES</h2>\n<p><em>All communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.</em></p>\n<h4>LOREBORNE AND HIGHBORNE</h4>\n<p>In Fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and those who have expertise have the most power. This economy of information functions primarily through gifting and trading, and wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for a weapon or warm meal. As such, loreborne community members are the wealthiest in Fanewick and might be smaller, distinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger villages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What knowledge did your community teach you that you must now protect or share?</em></p>\n<p><em>What are you able to accomplish because of your upbringing that others outside your community do not understand?</em></p>\n<p><em>You once traded important knowledge for something terrible. What did you impart and what did you gain in return?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having inherited riches built in the walled city over generations. While the highborne of Haven were more insulated from the Serpent’s Sickness, none were immune.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Who have you lost to the Serpent’s Sickness? How did it affect you?</em></p>\n<p><em>How did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected or embraced their core set of ethics?</em></p>\n<p><em>You grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from learning something about the world. What was this knowledge and when did you discover it?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>RIDGEBORNE, UNDERBORNE, AND WILDBORNE</h4>\n<p>Characters from these communities were likely raised in Fanewick’s deadly environs, which have only become more dangerous as the Witherwild grows. Each community has unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret, that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the Faint Divinities’ territories.</p>\n<p>In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves and their families, some Wicklings from these groups have been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields. Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What Faint Divinities do you give tribute to, and how have you been rewarded in kind?</em></p>\n<p><em>You displeased a god of Fanewick. What did you do, and what misfortune befell you or a loved one?</em></p>\n<p><em>You fled the place of your birth. What circumstances drove you to leave?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>ORDERBORNE</h4>\n<p>Players might choose to build orderborne characters if they want to play current or former members of the Haven Army that invaded Fanewick. Though the army brings violence into this land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland succumbing to disease.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of foreign soil?</em></p>\n<p><em>What kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you in an hour of need? How did this change your view of the people of Fanewick?</em></p>\n<p><em>You were charged with planting a rumor in a Fanewick community. What is the rumor, and do you plan to carry out this mission?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>SLYBORNE</h4>\n<p>As the Haven Army is the current martial power in Fanewick, those who wish to play slyborne characters might come from Fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. Depending on the tactics their group employs, a character from a slyborne community might align with or go against their upbringing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Who among the Haven Army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why?</em></p>\n<p><em>You joined an insurgent group working to free this land from Haven’s grasp. What has given you doubts about the leadership’s methods?</em></p>\n<p><em>Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>SEABORNE</h4>\n<p>Both Fanewick and Haven have a coastal border. The majority of Fanewick’s seaborne communities live in small seaside groups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while Haventies tend to live in large ports that ship and receive goods from distant lands.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What went terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it changed you?</em></p>\n<p><em>Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did you learn, and how did it save your life?</em></p>\n<p><em>You used to sail with a companion. Who were they, and how do you remain connected?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>WANDERBORNE</h4>\n<p>Wanderborne communities can be found in both Fanewick and Haven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military occupation and the expansion of the Witherwild. Whether a wanderborne character comes from Fanewick, Haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their character’s personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and how that aligns or departs from their community’s views.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden from Haven’s forces?</em></p>\n<p><em>Because of your community’s transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion?</em></p>\n<p><em>Your community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ANCESTRIES</h2>\n<p><em>All ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players.</em></p>\n<h4>CLANKS</h4>\n<p>Clanks from Haven are commonly made from iron and steel, while clanks from Fanewick are typically constructed from wood and stone.</p>\n<h4>FUNGRIL</h4>\n<p>Since the Witherwild spread throughout Fanewick, some fungril inhabiting the forests have grown noticeably larger than fungril from other regions.</p>\n<h4>DRAKONA, FAUNS, FIRBOLGS, AND INFERNIS</h4>\n<p>After the Witherwild corrupted Fanewick, some drakona, fauns, firbolgs, and infernis have noticed their horns growing faster and longer.</p>\n<h4>GALAPA AND RIBBETS</h4>\n<p>Many families of galapa and ribbets who lived in the bogs of Fanewick were displaced when Haven’s army invaded.</p>\n<p><strong>Haventies and the Serpent’s Sickness</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone, but especially those from Haven, may carry the Serpent’s Sickness, which stiffens their movements and gives them limited time to survive without a cure.</p>\n<h2>CLASSES</h2>\n<p><em>All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players.</em></p>\n<h4>DRUIDS, RANGERS, AND SORCERERS</h4>\n<p>Druids, rangers, and sorcerers are commonly found throughout Fanewick. If players choose one of these classes, they should consider how their character’s connection to the natural world might be impacted by the Witherwild.</p>\n<h4>WARRIORS AND WIZARDS</h4>\n<p>Warriors and wizards are prevalent in Haven. A large wizarding school in Haven teaches fighters and healers, and the Haven Army is largely composed of warriors and School of War wizards. If a PC is either of these classes, consider their personal relationship to the Haven Army.</p>\n<h4>VENGEANCE GUARDIAN</h4>\n<p>Many Wicklings who seek revenge on Haven or to expel them from Fanewick become Vengeance guardians. If players choose this subclass, they should consider what ideals or institutions their character protects.</p>\n<h4>SYNDICATE ROGUE</h4>\n<p>The Haven Army sends spies into Fanewick communities to gain information and undermine their actions and public perception. When selecting the Syndicate rogue subclass, players should consider how their character might be connected to or impacted by these covert operatives.</p>\n<h2>PLAYER PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<p><em>If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.</em></p>\n<h4>MAKE THE INVASION PERSONAL</h4>\n<p>Consider how Haven’s invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts your character. Let these details inform what they want and what they’re willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved one to the Witherwild or the Serpent’s Sickness, and more are dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict caused your character to act in ways they aren’t proud of, or transformed personal truths they once believed were unshakable.</p>\n<h4>TREAT DEATH WITH IMPORTANCE</h4>\n<p>Taking a life should not be done without consideration, desperation, and consequences. As your character journeys, they should remember those they’ve lost and those they’ve slain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future.</p>\n<h4>EMBRACE VULNERABILITY</h4>\n<p>Find your character’s humanity and showcase it whenever you can. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as they are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies even if they close themselves off to everyone else.</p>\n<h2>GM PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<p><em>Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.</em></p>\n<h4>PAINT THE WORLD IN CONTRAST</h4>\n<p>Subvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to charm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the natural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and devastating homes and communities. Show the grim and ordered life behind Haven’s walls, but also show the culture, art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety. Contrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with the devotion of the Wicklings and Haventies fighting to save their home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons, and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold dualities.</p>\n<h4>SHOW THEM TRUE DANGER</h4>\n<p>Though it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy that can befall the characters. To illustrate what’s truly at stake, use the PCs’ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends, communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these aspects of their past—when your players create and are invested in their character’s backstory, they have something to fight for.</p>\n<h4>OFFER ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE</h4>\n<p>By illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the PCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For example, showing compassion—rather than swordpoint—to a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild. Similarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldn’t only be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both could also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven and Fanewick from within.</p>\n<h4>CREATE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES</h4>\n<p>No adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have multidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go undiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the right thing, even if it’s for the wrong reason. Just because a PC or NPC is from Haven doesn’t make them a villain, and, conversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous. Finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations of the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense of attachment to the world for the players.</p>\n<h2>DISTINCTIONS</h2>\n<p><em>Use this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.</em></p>\n<h4>THE WEEKS OF DAY AND NIGHT</h4>\n<p>The day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night.</p>\n<p>But this cycle doesn’t just affect Wicklings; it’s dictated how Fanewick’s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes as Fanewick’s nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal counterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a week. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of forest—a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.</p>\n<h4>THE SERPENT’S SICKNESS</h4>\n<p>The plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but the effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of the crimson lady’s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to protect or cure themselves.</p>\n<p>In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. The final stages of the Serpent’s Sickness is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.</p>\n<h4>LADY’S VEIL</h4>\n<p>These small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout Fanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even so, they were only foraged until the Haventies discovered crimson lady’s veil—the only known cure for Serpent’s Sickness.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpent’s Sickness.</p>\n<h4>THE WITHERWILD</h4>\n<p>This corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is spreading throughout Fanewick. Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the bogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries.</p>\n<p>When a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming “Corruption from the Witherwild” section), they are transformed. They become a nightmarish hybrid—their body warped and intertwined with plant or beast. The Witherwild slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted Fanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are gifted this power by Nikta’s wrath to drive the forces of Haven from Fanewick and return the Shepherd’s Reaping Eye.</p>\n<h4>THE GODS OF FANEWICK</h4>\n<p>Gods in this land aren’t ethereal concepts that exist in another realm; instead, they are tangible and as inescapable as the seasons. Many communities, and some larger families, even have their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them.</p>\n<p>Belief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewick—there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of Seasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and visible impact on everyone in Fanewick.</p>\n<p>Fanewick’s various divinities each have their own opinion concerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy nature’s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are more accessible than gods who watch from on high.</p>\n<p><strong>Fulgr, Stacker of Stones:</strong> A small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. He is largely untroubled about the problems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyacyins, They Who Spread Small Blossoms:</strong> A friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. They’re enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it.</p>\n<p><strong>Ikla, the Sky Painter:</strong> Ikla’s artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off.</p>\n<p><strong>Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom:</strong> He is one of the few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. It’s rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End:</strong> A quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesn’t receive many visitors, but the Witherwild’s corruptive growth has made her job harder and opened her quiet existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Rokhin, the Wandering Horn:</strong> Rokhin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, he’s seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.</p>\n<p>These are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of gods watching, lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout Fanewick.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any?</em></p>\n<p><em>How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters encounter?</em></p>\n<p><em>Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the endless spring? Which align with Fanewick?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>THE INCITING INCIDENT</h2>\n<p><em>You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own.</em></p>\n<p>The Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the central tower of Haven’s wizarding school, seemingly impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the <strong>Fanewraith</strong> (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they weren’t when Haven invaded.</p>\n<p>Haven’s beleaguered spymaster, <strong>Kreil Dirn</strong> (he/him), is not a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on Haven’s internal activities. Kreil has never agreed—at least not openly—with <strong>Archmage Phylax’s</strong> (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating.</p>\n<p>Recently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith’s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.</p>\n<p>The party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to recover the Reaping Eye?</p>\n<p>Kreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith in the treetop village of Alula, where he suspects she runs her operation.</p>\n<h2>CAMPAIGN MECHANICS</h2>\n<p><em>The following mechanics are unique to this campaign.</em></p>\n<h4>CORRUPTION FROM THE WITHERWILD</h4>\n<p>Adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain Wither tokens. When a PC takes damage from a Withered adversary or environment, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted how they would normally appear or operate. You also gain about 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens you use for Fear).</p>\n<p>Any time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered adversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it on that PC’s character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll their Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of Wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and clear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them permanently.</p>\n<p>At the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the PCs’ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character ever dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is permanently taken over by the Witherwild.</p>\n<h4>SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS</h4>\n<p><em>Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What dangerous animal comes out during the week of night that isn’t out during the week of day?</em></p>\n<p><em>What unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste) does anything tainted by the Witherwild have?</em></p>\n<p><em>What superstitions does your character or their community have about traversing Fanewick during the long nights?</em></p>\n<p><em>Your character has witnessed something beautiful that came from the Witherwild. What is it and how has it transformed their view of the corruption?</em></p>\n</blockquote>",

Examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry.</p>\n<p>Many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it’s also common for clanks to build one another. A clank’s lifespan extends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency.</p>\n<h2>ANCESTRY FEATURES</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Purposeful Design:</em></strong> Decide who made you and for what purpose. At character creation, choose one of your Experiences that best aligns with this purpose and gain a permanent +1 bonus to it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Efficient:</em></strong> When you take a short rest, you can choose a long rest move instead of a short rest move.</p>",
